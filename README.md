Official Doc for OTR
#Information: This project was created with a Node and Express template from Webstorm. Thus was have the app.js, users.js, and index.js files 
in the application. I commented them out, but I did not delete them for refactoring purposes.
#To Start the app, please use either the following commands: node controller.js or nodemon controller.js
#This CLI app is built on Node and KOA.JS
#The command line POST commands to the endpoints were accomplished by using cURL. Example: To create a basic post command you would type
curl -v -H "Content-Type:text/plain" -d "LastName|First|Gender|FavoriteColor|Birthdate" http://localhost:3000/records
